        <h1>Get your parts in order</h1>
        <p>
        Once you have all the parts to build your PC, make sure they are organized in a functional workspace.
        </p>
        <h3>Ground yourself</h3>
        <p>
        You don't want to go messing around with hundreds of dollars of electric components without eliminating the risk of shorting a component with a static shock. To do this you can get an anti-static bracelet. Alternatively, you can just ground yourself every so often by touching your hand to a piece of conductive metal, most of the time your PC case will work.
        </p>
        <h3>Open your case</h3>
        <p>
        The screws to open the side panel of your case should be at the back along the side of the case. Undo them and make sure it is prepped to install the parts you plan to put in.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your power supply</h3>
        <p>
        In most cases the power supply goes at the bottom of the case. Find the spot where it is meant to go and slide it in so that the plug and power switch are facing the outside. Screw it in to secure it.
        </p>
        <h3>Unbox you motherboard</h3>
        <p> 
        Most motherboards come inside of an anti-static shroud to protect itself during transit. Remove it and place your motherboard on top of it - it will make for a safe work surface.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your processor</h3>
        <p>
        Unlatch the motherboard's processor cover. Carefully move your processor into its slot. Be sure to avoid touching the sensitive gold pins on the motherboard and processor by only touching the sides of the chip. There will most likely be an arrow both on the processor and the motherboard to show the correct orrientation for the CPU to be installed. When the processor is in, give it a gentle nudge to make sure it has a snug fit. If there is any major rattling or movement pick up your processor and make sure it is lined up correctly.
        </p>
        <h3>Install the RAM</h3>
        <p>
        If you only have two dims of RAM install them into the slots of matching color on your motherboard. Again, be careful to avoid touching the gold pins of any of your parts. Open the latches on either side of each RAM slot. Insert your RAM sticks into the slots - there will be a noticeable click as the latches lock into place. If you need to change the positioning of your RAM, undo the latches before trying to take any of the dims out.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your CPU cooler</h3>
        <p>
        If you chose a heatsink as your CPU cooler, now is the time to install it. First, install the bracket for your heatsink with the screws included in the package. Next, prime the surface of your CPU and the contact point of the heatsink by cleaning them with rubbing alcohol. Be sure to check that there is no dust or residue on either of the surfaces so that no cooling performance is compromised. Next, apply your thermal compound to the surface of your CPU - remember less is more - you probably only need about a pea sized blob of compound. Now drop on your heatsink being sure to align it with the fastening bracket. Screw on your heatsink and ensure that it is securely tightened.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you chose a liquid cooler, choose a spot in your case that supports the radiator size you chose and screw it in. Similarly, screw in the brackets where the contact point for the cooler will be secured. This will be all for now until you have your motherboard installed.
        </p>
		<h3>Install your i/o shield onto the back of your motherboard</h3>
        <p>
        Pop the cover onto the back of your motherboard (near all of the ports) to give it a better finish and protect it from dust. 
        </p>
        <h3>Install your motherboard standoffs on your case</h3>
        <p>
        There should be a set of peg-looking metal standoffs included with your motherboard. Pop these into your case and secure them. This will be where you screw your motherboard on in order to secure it to your case.
        </p>
        <h3>Remove the motherboard i/o cover from your case</h3>
        <p>
        Simply pop out the i/o cover from the part of your case where the motherboard is meant to go in.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your motherboard</h3>
        <p>
        Screw your motherboard into the standoffs you put in earlier, making sure that it is in the correct orientation and that the ports face the back of the case.
        </p>
        <h3>Plug in case connectors</h3>
        <p>
        Your case will have included connectors for the LED lights, the power button, and/or front i/o ports. Plug and cords into your motherboard in the designated spots on the motherboard and power supply if it requires separate power.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now would also be a good time to screw in the rest of your liquid cooler if that's the cooler you chose. Clean the surfaces of your cooler and CPU before applying thermal compound and screwing it down.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your graphics card</h3>
        <p>
        Remove the panel covers that will interfere with your GPU's rear ports. These are commonly held in with screws so you may need a screwdriver.
        </p>
        <p>
        Open the latches and then plug in your GPU to the PCIe slot closest to your CPU (It doesn't affect performance it just saves space.) Push steadily on your card until you feel a pop of the latches locking the card into place.
        </p>
        <p>
        Screw your graphics card into place at the back of the case using the same screws that were securing the panel covers.
        </p>
        <p> 
        If you have any other PCIe cards, install them in the same manner.
        </p>
        <h3>Install your storage drives</h3>
        <p>
        Locate the drive bays for your hard drives or SSDs. Secure your storage devices either with screws or with a screwless solution if your case has one. Once secured, plug in your SATA cables to each of your drives being sure to plug the other side into your motherboard. Be sure to supply your drives with power by connecting them to your power supply.
        </p>
        <h3>Plug in all of your parts</h3>
        <p>
        Each of your parts will have power pins that require a power cord. Your motherboard will need the large 24 pin power connector and your GPU will need either a 6 or two 4 pin power connectors. Plug in any case fans to your motherboard for power.
        </p>
        <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
        <p>
        Plug in your display cable into your display and your GPU (if you didn't choose to buy a GPU use one of the video ports from your motherboard). Plug in your external disk reader, mouse, and keyboard. 
        </p>
        <h3>Power on your computer</h3>
        <p>
        This is the biggest and most rewarding part of the build. If everything works correctly your PC should POST (Power On Self Test) successfully. When this happens redirect to your bios by pressing the DELETE key. Once in the bios, change your boot settings so that you boot from your disk drive. Doing this should start your install of Windows - install to your SSD if you have one because this will make startup lighyears faster. Once the install is complete, throw away your disk drive because we're not living in the '90s. After you've gotten that out of the way, change your boot drive to the one you installed Windows to. 
        </p>
        <p>
        You're Done!!! Congratulations, just install your normal software and update your hardware drivers then you're set to use your brand new, custom built PC.
