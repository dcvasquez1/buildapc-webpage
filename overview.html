        <h1>Decide your budget</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most misconceiving thoughts poeple have about building a pc - particularly a gaming PC - is that it can't be cheap.
            This is just false. Building a PC by hand could cost you less than buying the cheapest one available at your local BestBuy, you just need to know what parts you need. The mandatory parts in a PC include a case, a CPU, a cooler, a motherboard, a power supply, RAM, storage, and an operating system. If you are building a PC for more than just browsing, it will definitely be a good idea to get a graphics card, or GPU, aswell.
            Let's do a quick run through each of these parts so you know what they each do.
            The CPU, or central processing unit, is the heart of your PC. It will be what performs most tasks on your computer from loading webpages to loading up your operating system. The two main brands of CPU are AMD and Intel. For quite a while now, at least on the consumer market, Intel has been the standard. 
            Regardless of brand name, the two main things you should consider when buying a processor is the amount of cores it has and its clock speed. The higher the clock speed the faster your PC will run, the same thing is true of core count.
            So if you are going to buy Intel you should know the basics of their products. There are now 4 lines you can choose from i3, i5, i7, or i9. The main differences concern overall quality with i3 being the lowest and i9 being the highest. i3 processors almost all have 2 cores, and will thus have the least processing power. i5 processors on the other hand almost all have 4 cores, which give them a noticeable advantage over the lower i3's. The next step is a little more funky because i7 processors come in 4, 6, 8, and even up to 10 core variants. So what makes a 4-core i7 better than a 4-core i5? Well, Intel's i7 processors include a feature called "hyperthreading" which we won't go into intense detail in this overview, but it basically means that cores with hyperthreading can handle a larger synthetic load because they have twice the threads. Lastly, we have the i9 processors which are very new to the party. The i9 processors are geared heavily at enthusiasts and professional applications. As you can expect the i9 has more cores and more power, with their largest processor to date having 18 cores! This is most likely not the range you should be looking for, though. The largest selling point of the i9 comes mainly in the form of server applications because of its immense capability for managing a huge amount of PCI-express slots which we will talk about later. The last thing you should note about choosing an Intel processor is the suffix. Processors with a "K" or an "X" at the end of the processor number mean that this processor is "unlocked" and therefore supports consumer overclocking. If you have no interest in overclocking then you could save a few bucks by choosing a processor without that suffix.
            The next part we should talk about is the CPU cooler. The cooler, as you might expect, keeps the CPU cool. This may not matter if you have no plans of overclocking, in which case you could just buy a processor that has a stock cooler included in the pakage. However, if you decide to do a custom cooling solution there are a few more choices and lots more performance to be gained by overclocking. The most common coolers are plain old heatsinks. They work by having a conductive metal in hundreds of fins to be cooled by a fan that is attached to it. The main thing to look at when buying a heatsink is surface area material.
