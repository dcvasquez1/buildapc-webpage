        <h1>Decide your budget</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most misconceiving thoughts poeple have about building a pc - particularly a gaming PC - is that it can't be cheap.
            This is just false. Building a PC by hand could cost you less than buying the cheapest one available at your local BestBuy, you just need to know what parts you need. The mandatory parts in a PC include a case, a CPU, a cooler, a motherboard, a power supply, RAM, storage, and an operating system. If you are building a PC for more than just browsing, it will definitely be a good idea to get a graphics card, or GPU, aswell.
            Let's do a quick run through each of these parts so you know what they each do.
            The CPU, or central processing unit, is the heart of your PC. It will be what performs most tasks on your computer from loading webpages to loading up your operating system. The two main brands of CPU are AMD and Intel. For quite a while now, at least on the consumer market, Intel has been the standard. 
            Regardless of brand name, the two main things you should consider when buying a processor is the amount of cores it has and its clock speed. The higher the clock speed the faster your PC will run, the same thing is true of core count.
            So if you are going to buy Intel you should know the basics of their products. There are now 4 lines you can choose from i3, i5, i7, or i9. The main differences concern overall quality with i3 being the lowest and i9 being the highest. i3 processors almost all have 2 cores, and will thus have the least processing power. i5 processors on the other hand almost all have 4 cores, which give them a noticeable advantage over the lower i3's. The next step is a little more funky because i7 processors come in 4, 6, 8, and even up to 10 core variants. So what makes a 4-core i7 better than a 4-core i5? Well, Intel's i7 processors include a feature called "hyperthreading" which we won't go into intense detail in this overview, but it basically means that cores with hyperthreading can handle a larger synthetic load because they have twice the threads. Lastly, we have the i9 processors which are very new to the party. The i9 processors are geared heavily at enthusiasts and professional applications. As you can expect the i9 has more cores and more power, with their largest processor to date having 18 cores! This is most likely not the range you should be looking for, though. The largest selling point of the i9 comes mainly in the form of server applications because of its immense capability for managing a huge amount of PCI-express slots which we will talk about later. The last thing you should note about choosing an Intel processor is the suffix. Processors with a "K" or an "X" at the end of the processor number mean that this processor is "unlocked" and therefore supports consumer overclocking. If you have no interest in overclocking then you could save a few bucks by choosing a processor without that suffix.
            The next part we should talk about is the CPU cooler. The cooler, as you might expect, keeps the CPU cool. This may not matter if you have no plans of overclocking, in which case you could just buy a processor that has a stock cooler included in the pakage. However, if you decide to do a custom cooling solution there are a few more choices and lots more performance to be gained by overclocking. The most common coolers are heatsinks. They work by having a conductive metal in hundreds of fins to be cooled by a fan that is attached to it. The main thing to look at when buying a heatsink is surface area and material. The more fins and heatpipes a heatsink has to easier it will be to transfer heat away from the CPU. Similarly, a good material will conduct the heat more efficiently - the two most common are aluminum and copper. The other option for cooling is liquid cooling. This involves pumping a liquid over a contact area with the CPU and the moving it through a radiator to cool it down. For first time PC builders that want to go with liquid cooling, it is recommended that you avoid doing a custom loop and instead go with an all in one package. Making a custom loop is a complex process that is reserved for the most well versed builders. 
            Motherboards are the skeleton and nervous system of the computer. They connect all the parts and make them perform as one cohesive unit. The main thing you want to do when choosing a motherboard is check that it supports the chipset of the processor you chose. The rest of the choices with motherboards is based off of what you want your system to be able to do. This includes choosing how many RAM slots, PCIe lanes, and add-ons you want to be included like on board wifi or high quality audio.
            RAM is a pretty quick choice. Basically choose how much you want and buy that much. The most common packages are 4, 8, 16, and 32 gigabytes. 
            Next is long term storage. For this you can choose to go with an SSD or a standard spinning disk hard drive. The main benefit of an SSD is the MUCH faster speeds. Having an SSD can cut down on load times, increase startup speed and improve general performance. The problem with SSD's is that they are much more expensive per gigabyte. You can find a 2TB hard drive that will cost around a hundred dollars, but for that kind of SSD storage you would have to shell out a pretty penny. 
            A GPU is nearly mandatory if you plan to do any sort of gaming on your PC. When choosing a graphics card there are two main chipset manufacturers - Nvidia and AMD. For graphics cards, you basically get what you pay for, with the mid to upper tier cards costing between three and four hundred dollars. It may be a bit daunting when buying a GPU because there are many different companies that each have their own custom cooling solutions for increased clock speeds. Don't be freaked out, though, generally if you choose from a trusted brand the main difference will be which one is on sale. Trusted brands include gigabyte, EVGA, ASUS, and MSI (not to say other brands won't perform well). If you really care about the ranking of which GPU coolers are the best for a certain chipset, you can look up a ranking of them online that show their clock speeds and power draw. 
            The last mechanical component your PC will need is a power supply. The two things to look for in a power supply are total wattage and efficiency. Wattage will be pretty clear, but the efficiency goes by a different system. The most trusted efficiency system is the 80+ system with 80+ Bronze being the lowest ranking and the higher ones being 80+ Gold, Platinum, and even Titanium. Efficiency is not that big of a deciding factor, though, the main thing is to check that the power supply will provide enough power to your system. This one is pretty easy, just add up the maximum power draw of each of your components - the big two are your CPU and GPU. You should probably give yourself a little bit of overhead to give yourself room so maybe round up a hundred watts or so to keep it comfortable. Don't go overboard, however. It may seem tempting to buy a 1500 watt 80+ Titanium power supply, but almost no consumer computer in the world would actually necessitate that power.
            Finally, to hold it all in, you will need a computer case. Choosing a case comes down to size and aesthetic quality. If you just want any old case just make sure it supports whatever size motherboard you choose. 
            You will also need an operating system. Just get Windows 10 and an external DVD drive to install it. You can get the "Professional" version if you want the extra features.
            Also make sure you have all the peripherals you need like a mouse, keyboard and monitor. These are all based off of preference.
